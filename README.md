# COSC 241 Final Project: Pacman Capture-the-Flag

## Overview
This project is a solution to the course contest, which involves a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman. In this game, agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. Your team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map while defending the food on your home side.
